Poker Hand Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project aims to classify poker hands using traditional machine learning techniques in Google Colab. The goal is to apply core ML best practices such as Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization to observe performance improvements over iterations.

Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Poker Hand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Each instance represents a poker hand with 10 numerical features and a label from 0 (Nothing in hand) to 9 (Royal flush).

Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Model Selection (e.g. SVM, Random Forest)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** (GridSearchCV / Manual tuning)
- **Regularization** (e.g. L2 for Logistic Regression or kernel tricks in SVM)
- **Optimization** (e.g. SGD, Adam on certain models if applicable)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

Iterative Improvements
- **Version 1**: Baseline model training  
- **Version 2**: Added hyperparameter tuning  
- **Version 3**: Applied regularization techniques  
- **Version 4**: Used optimized solvers or training strategies  
Each version includes comments and markdown in the notebook explaining what changed and how accuracy was impacted.


How to Run
1. Open the Colab notebook: [Link to notebook]
2. Run each cell in order (no installation needed)
3. Modify parameters or use your own dataset if needed
