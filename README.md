Poker Hand Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project aims to classify poker hands using traditional machine learning techniques. The goal is to apply core ML best practices such as Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization to observe performance improvements over iterations.

Dataset
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mateotfuentes/poker-hand-classifier

Methods & Techniques
- Data Preprocessing (missing values, normalization, etc.)
- Algorithms used:
  + Logistic Regression
  + Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  + Random Forest Classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Regularization 
- Optimization using different solvers

Model Improvement Steps

Each version below is marked and commented in the Colab notebook:
1. Version 1: Baseline model without tuning  
2. Version 2: Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning  
3. Version 3: Added regularization to reduce overfitting  
4. Version 4: Changed optimization strategy for better performance  

Performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix) are provided after each version for comparison.

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report
